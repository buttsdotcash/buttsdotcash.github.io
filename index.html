	<p> You might be wondering, who would sign up the website butts.cash? Well, this guy would: </p>

	<p> This is a picture of me making this very website. You get the idea here. </p>
	<br> 
	<br>
	<p> You may now be wondering, "What is the point of this website? Is it just pictures of this guy? Is there anything else to do here?" Let me answer these questions for you now. </p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><h2>"What is the point of this website?"</h2></i>
	<br>
	<p> I'm so glad you asked! It is highly likely you're reading this because I told you I owned the URL butts.cash (as is the natural impulse that occurs in a person who owns such a domain name) and, 
		either disbelieving or intriguied, you loaded up this website to see what it contained. Prior to the existence of this website, when this interaction happened, anyone attemtping to load this website 
		would be met with a parked page. This seemed like a poor use of such a good domain name, so I decided I had to put at least something on here. This is that something! </p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><h2>"Is it just pictures of this guy?"</h2></i>
	<br>
	<p> When I was planning this, I decided it was important to have pictures of myself on the website. If the whole point of this website is proving to people that I own the URL butts.cash, there has to be
		some kind of evidence. So, in some senses, yes, this website is just pictures of me. Although, if you click around, you might find something else. </p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><h2>"Is there anything else to do here?"</h2></i>
	<br>
	<p> See previous question. </p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<i><h2>"What now?"</h2></i>
	<br>
	<p> I know, I know! You didn't ask this one, but you were probably thinking it. If we're talking in person, you can stop reading now. This website has served its purpose. If you're a returning visitor,
		perhaps you can try finding whatever fun hidden things I put in here before I got bored of making HTML do stuff (it's easier than you might think, but also very boring)</p>
